# Advanced Power BI Dashboard • End-to-End • ChatGPT • Custom Visuals

##  Overview
This project is a **Power BI** dashboard originally inspired by a tutorial that leveraged **Python**, **ChatGPT**, **HTML**, and **DENEB custom visuals** to deliver an interactive, data-rich visualization—showcasing Spotify track data with dynamic album art, charts, and stylistic design.

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – report building, layout & interaction  
- **Python** – data enrichment & API integration  
- **ChatGPT** – assisted code generation for Spotify API calls  
- **HTML Visuals** within Power BI – dynamic styling, glassmorphism effects  
- **DENEB Custom Visuals** – doughnut and heatmap visuals for advanced storytelling  

##  Data Enrichment Workflow
1. Downloaded a Spotify dataset (e.g., track metadata) from Kaggle or similar source.  
2. Used **Python** to connect to the **Spotify Web API** and enrich the dataset with album cover image URLs.  
3. Employed **ChatGPT** to generate and refine the Python script for authentication and API calls.  
4. Saved output as an enriched CSV to be used in Power BI.  

*(Insert your own Python snippet and ChatGPT prompt if you want to showcase)*

##  Dashboard Components
### Visuals & Pages
- **Custom DENEB Doughnut** – visualizes top-performing artists or genres.  
- **DENEB Heatmap** – displays streams or plays by time or category trends.  
- **HTML/Stylized Visuals** – album covers and cards styled with glassmorphism for a modern UI aesthetic.

You can download and reference DENEB visuals from the Power BI Visuals Marketplace.
